# PokéJar
CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Phase 0: Project Idea and User Stories

### What?
PokéJar is an application designed to 
analyze the stats and quality of Pokémon teams
in order to help anyone become a true Pokémon Master.

### Why?
This project is of interest to me because 
I've recently gotten my first Pokémon game -- Pokémon Violet. 
As a new player, I would love to have a toolset that makes 
it easier for anyone to master their Pokémon game.

### Who?
 - Pokémon trainers

### User Stories
 - As a user, I want to be able to add my Pokémon to my roster.
 - As a user, I want to be able to remove Pokémon from my roster.
 - As a user, I want to be able to change the stat of each Pokémon.
 - As a user, I want to be able to view the stats of each Pokémon.
 - As a user, I want to be able to view the combined stats of my team.
 - As a user, I want to be able to create multiple teams and compare them against each other.
