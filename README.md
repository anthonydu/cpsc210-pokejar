# PokéJar
CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Phase 0: Project Idea and User Stories

### What?

PokéJar is an application designed to analyze the stats of Pokémon teams.

### Why?

This project is of interest to me because
I've recently gotten my first Pokémon game &mdash; Pokémon Violet.
As a new player, an analytics toolset would make
it so much easier for me to master my Pokémon game.

### Who?

The targeted user group of this app are Pokémon trainers.
